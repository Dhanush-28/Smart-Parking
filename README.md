# Smart-Parking
INSTRUCTIONS:

Smart parking systems use technology to improve the parking experience for both
drivers and parking facility operators. These systems can help reduce congestion, save
time, and optimize the use of parking spaces. Here are instructions on how to set up
and use a smart parking system:

1.Planning and Installation:
a. Identify the location: Determine where you want to implement the smart parking
system.
b. Infrastructure setup: Ensure that you have the necessary infrastructure in place, such
as sensors, cameras, and communication equipment. 
c. Sensor installation: Install sensors (e.g., ultrasonic or magnetic sensors) in each
parking space. These sensors detect the presence of a vehicle and relay this
information to the central system.
d. Communication network: Establish a reliable network connection to connect all
sensors and cameras to a central server.
2.User-Facing Interfaces:
a. Mobile app: Develop a mobile app that allows drivers to find available parking
spaces, make reservations, and pay for parking. Ensure the app is user-friendly and
accessible on both Android and iOS platforms.
